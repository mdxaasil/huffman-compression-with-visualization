# Huffman Encoder

## Overview
The Huffman Encoder is a project that aims to design and implement a Huffman encoding algorithm for lossless data compression. The encoder generates variable-length prefix codes based on symbol frequencies, resulting in more compact data representation. This project demonstrates an understanding of the Huffman coding algorithm and its application in data compression.

## Features
- Efficient encoding of input data using Huffman coding
- Generation of variable-length prefix codes based on symbol frequencies
- Visualization of the Huffman tree for enhanced understanding
- Compression of various data types, including text, images, and multimedia files
- Decompression of Huffman-encoded data back to its original form
